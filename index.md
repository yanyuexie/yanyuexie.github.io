Hi! I am currently a Ph.D. student at Northeastern University, advised by [Prof. Xue (Shelley) Lin](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/lin-xue/) and [Prof. Yanzhi Wang](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/wang-yanzhi/), starting from Fall 2020. My research interests include algorithm/hardware co-design, FPGAs, and electronic design automation.

Previously, I received my B.E. degree in microelectronic science and engineering from Fudan University, in 2020. During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Jinmei Lai](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/60/0e/c31147a352270/page.htm), [Prof. Lei He](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/lei-he/), and [Prof. Jianli Chen](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/5f/c6/c31141a352198/page.htm).
